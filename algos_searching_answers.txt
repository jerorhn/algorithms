1. Using linear search, it would take 7 iterations to get to G.
2. Using binary search, it would take 3 iterations to get to G.
3. fib(10) = 21 + 34 = 55
   fib(11) = 34 + 55 = 89
   fib(12) = 55 + 89 = 144

Calculating fibonnaci recursively takes 0.000057.  Iteratively it takes 0.000018.  

1. An unsorted collection can only be searched linearly.
2. I would search a large sorted collection using a recursive binary search.  Binary search is much quicker because it cuts out half of the items with each iteration.  I would choose a recursive version because it takes less time to run.  Using benchmarks, it takes the same million item collection 0.000050 to run iteratively but only 0.000015 to run recursively.
